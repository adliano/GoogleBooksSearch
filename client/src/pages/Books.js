/**
 *
We import the API module into our component.
When the component is created the componentDidMount lifecycle method is called.
Inside we call this.loadBooks() which we've defined below.

this.loadBooks() uses the API utility module to retrieve all of the
books from the database and then calls this.setState() to set them to this.state.books.

Even though we don't know much about how our backend is configured, we were still able
to make an AJAX request to it to retrieve all of the books. This is because we're using the API
helper module which contains methods for making requests to various endpoints.

Further down below, a list is being rendered from this.state.books.
When the list is empty, a message is displayed explaining this. Otherwise the list of books is rendered.
