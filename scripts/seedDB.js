    "Southpointe High is the last place Lucy wanted to wind up her senior year of school. Right up until she stumbles into Jude Ryder, a guy whose name has become its own verb, and synonymous with trouble. He's got a rap sheet that runs longer than a senior thesis, has had his name sighed, shouted, and cursed by more women than Lucy dares to ask, and lives at the local boys home where disturbed seems to be the status quo for the residents. Lucy had a stable at best, quirky at worst, upbringing. She lives for wearing the satin down on her ballet shoes, has her sights set on Juilliard, and has been careful to keep trouble out of her life. Up until nowâ€¦ Jude's everything she knows she needs to stay away from if she wants to separate her past from her future. But she's about to find out that staying away is the only thing she's incapable of.",    date: new Date(Date.now())

    "Highlights! is an innovative series of original works of fiction aimed at students aged between 10 to 15 years who find reading challenging. In the book Crash!, it deals with courage and self-reliance. Nalini and Zed are flying to visit their relatives for a holiday. Their plane encounters a huge storm and crashes near a deserted island. The pilot is killed and the teenagers are along. They manage to find shelter, food and even water. It seems almost too easy for two young people stranded all alone. Or are they alone?",
